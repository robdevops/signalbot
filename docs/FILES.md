# Files

Send the bot a file in a DM, attach one when you @mention it or reply to it, or @mention it in reply to someone else's file. Each reaches the model in the form it can use:

| File | What the model gets |
|---|---|
| PDF | The PDF itself. A model that reads files natively gets it as it is; for any other, OpenRouter reads it first with its `mistral-ocr` engine, which handles tables, columns and scanned pages |
| Audio, including voice notes | The audio, if the model takes audio (OpenRouter's model list says); otherwise a note that it can't hear it |
| Text and code (`.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, source files, …) | Its text, up to 50,000 characters |
| Word, Excel, PowerPoint (`.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`) | Its text: paragraphs, cells by sheet, slides in order |
| Anything else | A note that it was attached and can't be read |

Up to 4 files a message, 12 MB each and 16 MB together (the model is told of any left out). **OCR costs money:** OpenRouter charges about $2 per 1,000 pages, so a 150-page filing is about $0.30 each time it's sent, on top of the reply, and shows in the reply's logged cost. The bot never keeps a file, so asking about it again means replying to it again, and it's read again. To fetch the original of a file someone else posted, the bot remembers recent attachments' IDs and names in memory for a day; see [PRIVACY.md](../PRIVACY.md). The log records each file's kind and size and what the model got, or that it was no longer available, never its name.
